- Security audits can be categorized based on their scope, methodology,and the aspects of the organization they focus on
- For penetration testers, understanding these different types of security
audits is crucial to tailor their testing strategies effectively.

#### Types of security audits
##### Internal Audits
- Conducted by the organization's internal
audit team or security professionals to
evaluate the effectiveness of internal
controls and compliance with policies.
- Internal audits provide insight into the
organization’s self-assessment of its
security posture and highlight areas
that may require more in-depth testing.
- An internal audit might review
user access controls to ensure
that only authorized personnel
have access to sensitive data.
##### External Audits
- Performed by independent third-party
auditors to provide an unbiased
evaluation of the organization’s security
measures and compliance with external
standards.
- External audits often serve as
benchmarks for compliance and security
effectiveness. Penetration testers can
use these findings to guide their testing
efforts.
- A company undergoing a PCI DSS
compliance audit might hire an
external auditor to validate its
security controls and ensure they
meet the required standards.

##### Compilance Audits
- Focus on verifying that the organization
complies with specific regulatory
requirements and industry standards
(e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
- Compliance audits help identify
regulatory gaps that penetration testers
can address through targeted testing.
- A healthcare provider might
undergo a HIPAA compliance
audit to ensure that patient data
is protected according to federal
regulations.

##### Technical Audits
- Focus on assessing the technical aspects
of the organization’s IT infrastructure,
including hardware, software, and
network configurations.
- Technical audits provide a detailed view
of the technical controls in place,
highlighting areas where penetration
testing can uncover vulnerabilities.
- A technical audit might involve a
thorough review of firewall
configurations to ensure they are
properly securing the network
perimeter.

#### Network audit
- Assess the security of the organization’s
network infrastructure, including routers,
switches, firewalls, and other network
devices.
- Network audits can reveal vulnerabilities
in network design and configurations
that penetration testers can exploit to
assess network security.
- A network audit might identify
insecure protocols being used for
data transmission, prompting
penetration testers to test for
potential exploits.


#### Applicatin audits
- Evaluate the security of software
applications, focusing on code quality,
input validation, authentication
mechanisms, and data handling.
- Application audits highlight security
flaws in applications that penetration
testers can exploit to demonstrate real-
world attack scenarios.
- An application audit might reveal
vulnerabilities such as SQL
injection or cross-site scripting
(XSS) in a web application.
