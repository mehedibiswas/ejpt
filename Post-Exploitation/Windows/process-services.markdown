#### Enumerating process and services
- After gaining initial access to a target system,it is always important to learn more about the system like,what processes,services and sheduled tasks are currently running.
####  What are we looking for?
 - Running process and services
 - Scheduled tasks
##### A process is an instance of a running executable(.exe) or program.
#### A service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop.

##### Lab
##### After gaining initial access
- in meterpreter session
- ps [ list runnig process ]
- pgrep explorer.exe [ identifying individual process  ]
- migrate 1239 [ migrating to explorer by using process id,explorer is a stable process,by this  we will gain access of x64 architecture ]
- 

#### In cmd shell
- net start [ this will list the started services ]
- wmic service list brief [ this will list all the services ]
- tasklist /SVC [this will list services under process ]
- schtasks /query /fo LIST [this will list all the schedule task ]
