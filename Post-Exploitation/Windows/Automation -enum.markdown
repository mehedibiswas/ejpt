#### Automating Windows local Enumeration
- In addition to performing local enumeration manually,we can also automate the process with the help of a few scripts and MSF modules.
- While local enumeration technique/commands are important to know as a penetration tester,you will need to be time efficient.As a result ,you will need to learn how to utilize various automated enumeration scripts.
- In addition to automating the process of enumerating information like system information,users & groups etc,these automated enumeration scripts will also provide you with additional information regarding the target system like; privilege escalation vulnerabilities,locally stored passwords etc.

#### Windows local enumeration scripts
- JAWS Just another windows(enum) script -JAWS is Powershell script designed to help penetration testers( and CTFers) quickly identiy potential privilege escalation vectors on windows systems.It is written using  Powershell 2.0 so should ru on every Windows version since windows 7

- run
##### module 2
- search enum_logged [ this will show logged in users in the system ]

###### module 3
- search checkvm [ this will check if target machine is vm? ]
- use  post/linux/gather/checkvm
##### module 4

- set session and run
##### module 5 
- search enum_computers [ this will all the computer connected to the network ]
- set session and run

### JAWS 
- Go to the JAWS official github

- (ctrl + shift + alt) to open clipboard 
- paste the raw content 
- now paste the clipboard content to lab enivornment editor and save it as ps1 extension as it is powershell command.
- now move the file into file into attacker machine
- always try to uplaod file in tmp directory while pentest if it does not exist create one.
- upload jaws.ps1 [meterpreter upload command ]
- shell [ for getting cmd shell ]
- powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWS-enum.txt [ run the powershell file and saved the output into jaws-enum.txt file ]
- this take while to complete the scan 
- ctrl + z [ background the shell ]
- downlaod jaws-enum.txt [ download the jaws file into attacker machine ]
