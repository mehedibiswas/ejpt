#### Upgrading shell
- After gaining non-interactive shell on the target system we need to upgrade it
- cat /etc/shells [ to list all the available shells in the linux target]
- /bin/bash -i [ upgrading to bash shell  if was installed in the target ]
- python --version [ check if python is installed]
- python -c 'import pty; pty spawn("/bin/bash")'
- perl --help [ check perl is installed or not ]
- perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
- export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
- export TERM=xterm
- export SHELL=bash
