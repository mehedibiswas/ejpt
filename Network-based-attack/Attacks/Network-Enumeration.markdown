#### Network Enumeration
- After the host discovery and port scanning phase of a penetration test,the next logical phase is going to involve service enumeration
- The goal of service enumeration is to gather additional,more specific/detailed information about the hosts/systems on a network and services running on said hosts
- This include information like account names,shares,misconfigured services and so on.
- This includes information like account names,shares,misconfigured services and so on.
- Like the scanning phase,enumeration involves active connection to the remote devices in the network.
- There are many protocols on network systems that an attacker an target if they been misconfigured or have been left enabled.
- In this section of the course,we will be exploring the various tools and techniques that can be used to interact with these protocols,with the intent of eventual/potentially exploiting them in later phases.
