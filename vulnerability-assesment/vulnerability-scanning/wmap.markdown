#### wmap
- wmap is a powerful feature-rich web application vulnerability scanner that can be used to automate web server enumeration and scan web applications for vulnerability.
- wmap is available as an MSF plugin and can be loaded directly into MSF
- wmap is fully integrated with msf,which consequently allows us to perform web app vulnerability scanning from within the MSF.
