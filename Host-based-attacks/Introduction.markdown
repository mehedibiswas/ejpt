##### Introduction to host based attack
- System/Host based attacks are the attacks that are targeted towards a specific or host running a specific operating system for example windows or linux
- Network services are not the only attack vector that can be targeted during a penetration test.
- System/Host based attacks usually come in to play after you have gained access to a target network,whereby,you will be required to exploit servers,workstations or laptops on the internal network
- System/host based attacks are primarily focused on exploiting inherent vulnerabilities on the target os.
-Unlike network based attacks,host based attacks are much more specialized and require an understanding of the target operating system and vulnerabilities that affect said operating system.
- Sytem/Host based attacks involve exploiting misconfiguration and inherent vulnerabilities within the target OS.
